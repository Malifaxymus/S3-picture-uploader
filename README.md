## S3 lorem picsum file-uploader
- make sure you have your aws-cli and config set up correctly
- go into s3_upload.js and input the appropriate region and bucket-name
- input the number of pictures you would like
- run `npm start` in the terminal
- watch the magic happen

note: the website sometimes rejects the api call for a reason I cant figure out, if this occurs just run the script again
note: the website has some holes on their picture data, so you may recieve 1-3 files that are empty, these will have to be mannually removed
